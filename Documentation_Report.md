# Smart Product Pricing Challenge - Documentation Report

## 1. Methodology

We developed an ensemble machine learning solution combining three gradient boosting models to predict e-commerce product prices from text descriptions.

## 2. Model Architecture

**Ensemble Approach:**
- LightGBM (40% weight)
- XGBoost (30% weight)
- Random Forest (30% weight)

**Hyperparameters:**
- Learning rate: 0.05
- Max depth: 8
- Number of estimators: 500-1000

## 3. Feature Engineering

Extracted 12 features from catalog_content:
- Text statistics (length, word count)
- Item Pack Quantity using regex
- Numerical values extraction
- Premium/material/size keyword detection

## 4. Implementation Details

**Preprocessing:**
- Log transformation of target variable
- StandardScaler for feature normalization
- Train-validation split (80-20)

**Training:**
- 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Weighted ensemble for final predictions

**Results:**
- Validation SMAPE: XX.XX%
- Public Leaderboard: XX.XX%
